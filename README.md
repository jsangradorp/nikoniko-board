# Generic App

This app was generated with the [ampersand cli tool](http://ampersandjs.com/learn/quick-start-guide).
Then it was "cleaned up" manually to remove everything non-essential (under my
criterion).

## How to run it

1. download/install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
1. install dependencies: `npm install`
1. run it: `npm start`
1. open http://localhost:3000 in a browser

## How to personalize it

- clone the repo
- `git grep -i 'generic.app'` and rename to your new app
- Grow it!

## How it's structured

See docs: http://ampersandjs.com/
